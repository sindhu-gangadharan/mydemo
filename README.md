# Building a Rest API using Node js, Express and design API using Swagger Hub

## Overview
Build a ReST API using node.js (hosted on Express) to expose product data. Use https://mockaroo.com/ to download mock data in JSON format and use it as data source.

Implement the below endpoints

1. An endpoint to expose product data by ID
2. An endpoint to search products by name
3. A batch endpoint that accepts a list of product IDs and returns their details. Also accept a list of fields to be returned in the response.

Create lint code, unit test code and generate code coverage.
Write Docker File for the API.

## Tools
npm, nvm (node version manager), eslint (use airbnb lint settings), mocha (test runner), chai (assertion library), nyc (code coverage)
